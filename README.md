# Asynchronous MPI 


The domain of quantum chemistry needs a library in which the main
kernels of Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are implemented. In the
library proposed in this project, we expose the main algorithms in a
simple language and provide a standard API and tests to enable the
development of high-performance QMCkl implementations taking
advantage of modern hardware.

See the [source code](https://github.com/v1j4y/calcPI_async_MPI/blob/master/org/main.org)
to read the documentation.
