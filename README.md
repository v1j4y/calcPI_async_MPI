Asynchronous communication using MPI. This project implements the following communication patterns:

1. Publish - Subscribe
2. Request - Reply

The goal is to implement such standard algorithms available via ZeroMQ with good old MPI.

See the [source code](https://github.com/v1j4y/calcPI_async_MPI/blob/master/org/main.org)
to read the documentation.
